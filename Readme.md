Each time you work on the project, activate the virtual environment using the command `source env/bin/activate`


# First time (and any time `requirements.txt` changes)
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but make sure the virtual enviroment is activated (if you are using one)




# Activating 

(Turn on virtual environment using `source env/bin/activate`)

In your terminal run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running Notebook for Project
1. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure the environment is running first.

2. Start a local server for notebook by running `juptyer lab`

3. A pop-up window in your browser should appear. It should resemble a filesystem but in the browser.

4. Double click on `Project.ipynb` to access the project.
